System hooks for FreePBX

## Why?
Currently to run systemhooks on FreePBX you essentially need the sysadmin module. This can be problematic if you wish to not be subject to Sangoma or their commercial interests.
 * Sysadmin requires registration
 * Sysadmin only runs officially on the FreePBX Distro
 * Sysadmin is closed source and doesn't allow security researchers to audit the functionality.

TODO: 
 * Everything Expanded list coming soon.
 * Fork Firewall to call on this module.
